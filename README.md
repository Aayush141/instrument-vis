The electropenetrograph (EPG) is a scientific instrument that allows ento-
mologists to study the feeding behaviors of piercing-sucking arthropods
such as aphids, sharpshooters, and ticks. 

By analyzing the EPG electrical signals, 
entomologists can gain a deeper understanding of arthropods’ feeding be-
haviors (Backus et al., 2019). Thus, the EPG is vital to the United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA) — which oversees the agriculture and
food production industries in the U.S — since deeper understanding of
arthropods can help develop efficient arthropod management methods.
These methods can promote sustainable and abundant agriculture by, for
instance, reducing harmful arthropods through alternative methods, rather
than relying on current pesticides and other pest control methods that harm
the environment.
Auburn is extending EPG instrumentation and methodology to blood-
sucking arthropods that feed on animal hosts. Ticks, in particular, are
of significant medical importance due to their ability to cause harm to
humans and animals. They spread disease-causing agents across all con-
tinents and are identified as primary carriers of livestock pathogens (Gall
et al., 2016). Despite of decades of efforts put into understanding tick-host
interactions, the temporal dynamics of tick feeding events remain unclear
because ticks’ feeding activities, such as mouthpart movements, tissue dam-
age, and salivation, take place within opaque host tissue over an extended
period (Backus and Reif, 2021). These challenges hinder a clear under-
standing of the feeding behavior of ticks. The use of EPG, however, holds
promise in overcoming these obstacles and providing insights into tick feed-
ing behavior and interactions with hosts. In a broader context, the use of
EPG is critical to combat dangerous diseases from tick-borne, flea-borne,
and mosquito-borne pathogens (Backus and Reif, 2021). A few notable
examples are Lyme disease, the West Nile virus, and malaria. With the
application of EPG, Auburn aims to develop effective control measures to
protect humans, companion animals, and livestock from diseases transmit-
ted by blood-sucking arthropods.


EPG researchers currently use an analogue EPG hardware system.


This is a digital all-encompassing visualizer software for the EPG, 
focusing on usability and efficiency of the waveform
analysis features along with the ability to annotate with experimental obser-
vations. This project aims to improve the user experience and productivity
of EPG researchers and lower the barrier of entry for new entomologists in
the field.
